    <h1> Just kinda having fun </h1>
    <p> I dunno really what to put here <br> Im a little busy </p>
    <h3> A Bit About Myself (I guess) </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> I really like cats </li>
        <li> Im hoping to make my own RPG games </li>
        <li> I like to bake! </li>
      </ul>
      <p> I guess I should give you something yummy to make... <br> Oh! Cake! <br> Now, Im kinda spacy, so I like to use box mix. BUT! There is a way to make it taste even better! </p>
      <ol>
        <li> The first way to help is to replace the oil with melted butter. It helps make it richer. </li>
        <li> You also can add milk to replace the water, which can aid the butter and make it denser. </li>
        <li> Add one more egg! Even if you already added a lot, it can really change the texture of the cake, specially of you whip it up a bit to make the egg fluffy. <br>
        </li>
